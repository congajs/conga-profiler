## Data Collectors

Data collectors are used to collect data during the lifetime of a request, and pass it over to the 
profiler after the request is finished.  You access information saved in a data collector from 
the dashboard.

Any bundle can register a data collector.  Tag a service with `profiler.data_collector`, and make 
sure it inherits from `DataCollectorInterface`.

If you are profiling data for a request, make sure your service is defined in the `request` scope.

##### Tag Your Collector

> You must tag your collector to register it with the profiler.  Tagged services are registered 
during the `kernel.compile` lifecycle hook.

```
# your-bundle/lib/resources/config/services.yml
 
services:
 
    custom_request_collector:
        scope: request
        constructor: "your-bundle:service/CustomDataCollector"
        arguments: ["@service_container"]
        tags:
            - { name: profiler.data_collector }
```

##### Data Collector Service

> The main responsibility of the service is to capture data and pass it off to the profiler.  You can 
capture data however you want, but when the request is finished and the profiler iterates through 
all of the registered collectors, `collectData` is called on each one and is expected to return 
the data to the profiler. 

```
// your-bundle/lib/service/CustomDataCollector.js
 
const { DataCollectorInterface } = require('@conga/framework-profiler').Collector;
 
class CustomDataCollector extends DataCollectorInterface {
    /**
     * Get the name for this data collector
     * @returns {String}
     * @abstract
     */
    getName() {
        return 'Custom Request Collector'
    }
 
    /**
     * See if this data collector has a dashboard view 
     * @returns {true|false}
     * @abstract
     */
    hasDashboard() {
        return true;
    }
 
    /**
     * See if this collector is enabled or not
     * @returns {Boolean}
     * @abstract
     */
    isEnabled() {
        // you might check a config parameter here, for instance ...
        return true;
    }
 
    /**
     * Collect data for a request
     * @param {Object} request The Conga request (express) object
     * @param {Object} response The Conga response (express) object
     * @param {Request} [document] The Profiler Request document
     * @returns {Promise}
     * @abstract
     */
    collectData(request, response, document = null) {
        return Promise.resolve({collected: 'data'});
    }
}
 
module.exports = CustomDataCollector; 
```

### VueJS Dashboard

If you want to render your collected data in the dashboard, you need to create a VueJS component 
for the dashboard to use.

The VueJS component should live at 
`lib/resources/conga-dashboard/collector/custom-request-collector/Component.js`.

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue';
 
// import './component.css';
 
export default Vue.extend({
 
    template: `<div id="custom-request-collector"></div>`,
     
    props: ['d', 'request'],
     
    watch: {
        request: function(request) {
            if (request === null) {
                return;
            }
            
            // do something with your data
            console.log('custom request collector', request.collectedData['Custom Request Collector']);
        }
    }
});
```

> You can only have one dashboard component per bundle, but you can have multiple data collectors 
in your bundle.  You can access all of the collected data from your component, and you're free to 
create your own view template.
