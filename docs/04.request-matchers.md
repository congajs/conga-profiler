## Request Matchers

The profiler has a number of configuration options, including the ability to enable and disable it.
This is important when you want to use bundles across environments.  On production, for instance, 
you wouldn't want to enable the profiler for every request all the time, it will hurt your 
performance.  Instead, you can configure matchers so you can debug specific requests and data.

```
profiler:
    
    # optional
    # even if not enabled, matchers may trigger a profiler on a request
    matchers:
        local:
            ip: 127.0.0.1
        
        foo:
            route: ^/api/blah/some/component
        
        bar: '@service.id'
```
