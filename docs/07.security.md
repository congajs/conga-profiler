## Security

The profiler might include sensitive information.

If you wish to include an additional layer of authentication, the controller that the dashboard 
component uses is behind a firewall that you are allowed to configure.

By default the firewall allows anonymous access, but if you change the authenticator and the 
provider, you can use your own authentication strategy.

Here's an example using an In-Memory provider with HTTP Basic Authentication:

```yml
profiler:
     
    # ...
     
    security:
        authenticator: '@security.firewall.authenticator.http_basic'
        provider:
            memory:
                users:
                    profiler:
                        password: let-me-in
                        roles: ROLE_PROFILER
```

This would prompt the user for username and password before allowing access to the profiler 
dashboard view.  In our example, the username would be *profiler* and the password would be 
*let-me-in*.

> Currently, only HTTP Basic authentication is supported for the profiler, but you are free to 
make your own service to process it.
