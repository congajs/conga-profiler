## Request Matchers

The profiler has a number of configuration options, including the ability to enable and disable it.
This is important when you want to use bundles across environments.  On production, for instance, 
you wouldn't want to enable the profiler for every request all the time, it will hurt your 
performance.  Instead, you can configure matchers so you can debug specific requests and data.

```
profiler:
    
    # optional
    # even if not enabled, matchers may trigger a profiler on a request
    matchers:
        local:
            ip: 127.0.0.1
        
        foo:
            route: ^/api/blah/some/component
        
        bar: '@service.id'
```

> The matcher keys can be anything you want, so name them something that makese sense to your use case.

Two specific keys are recognized: `ip`, `route`.

`ip` - Enables the profiler for all routes that originate from the matching IP address.

`route` - Enables the profiler for all routes that match the regular given expression.

> If the value is a string, it's assumed a service, like `bar: '@service.id'`.  

> The service must inherit from `RequestMatcherInterface` and implement the `matches` method.
