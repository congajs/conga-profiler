## Conga Profiler

The profiler `@conga/framework-profile` is used to track runtime performance while conga processes 
a request or handles some global action.  Most of the conga bundles are aware of the profiler and 
use it when available.  

The profiler uses the stopwatch component `@conga/stopwatch` to capture information and organize 
them into sections.

When enabled, the profiler saves all requests in the configured Bass manager, so you can review 
them in the dashboard.

All of the captured data can be viewed in the Conga Dashboard.
