## Installation

Install the bundle in your project directory:

```shell
$ npm install --save-dev @conga/framework-profiler
```

> The profiler is usually installed under the dev environment, but if you are planning on using it 
> in production, use the `--save` flag instead of `--save-dev`. 

Enable the bundle in your application configuration at `app/config/bundles.yml`:

```yaml
bundles:
    development:
        - "@conga/framework-profiler"
```
