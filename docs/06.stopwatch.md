## Stopwatch

The profiler uses the stopwatch utility `@conga/stopwatch` to gather information throughout its 
lifetime, but modifies the interface slightly to make working with Conga requests a little easier.

> You can add data to a global stopwatch and a request stopwatch.

### Global Stopwatch

This will add data to the global stopwatch.  The global stopwatch collects all data that did not 
originate from a request, or does not have a request object.

```javascript
const stopwatch = container.get('profiler.stopwatch');
 
stopwatch.start('my_event', 'my_category');
 
// ..
 
stopwatch.stop();
```

### Request Scope

The profiler makes it easy to tag a request to your stopwatch, so you can isolate it from all of 
the other things going on in your app at the same time.

```javascript
const stopwatch = container.get('profiler.stopwatch').request(req);
 
stopwatch.start('my_event', 'my_category');
 
// ..

stopwatch.stop();
``` 

> When the request is finished, the profiler iterates through the global data and includes 
everything that was captured during the start and finish times of the request.  

See the `@conga/stopwatch` bundle documentation for more usage examples.
