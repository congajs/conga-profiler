WORK IN PROGRESS

overview
--------

- web interface to view profile information on each request
- toolbar in dev environment overlays ontop of site, connects to websocket to send / receive information
- monitor every client js event that is fired, in order
    - if recording is enabled, save it for playback later
    - if recording is not enabled, but error recording is, save all steps up until the error
- interact with a stopwatch service for manual profiling and automated graph reports
    - every event listener uses the stopwatch service and so each event is automatically profiled on a high level
- add custom sections to profiler, and implement custom data collectors for your custom sections

profiler:
    
    # optional, if omitted, true is used
    # possible values are true, false, request
    # request means, only enabled for matched requests
    enabled: request
    
    # optional, if omitted, true is used
    # specify whether to enable the dashboard
    dashboard: true
    
    # optional, if omitted, true is used
    # specify whether or not to collection configuration data on each request
    collect_config: true
    
    # required
    bass:
        manager: default.nedb
    
    # optional, if omitted, true is used with defaults
    monitoring:
        # whether or not to enable stat monitoring
        # even if this is true, profiler.enabled must be set to either true or request or monitoring will not run 
        enabled: true
        
        # tells the ProfilerStatService how often to check for stats when there are no active requests
        delay_idle: 1000
        
        # tells the ProfilerStatService how often to check for stats when there is 1 or more active requests 
        delay_request: 50
        
        # tells the ProfilerStatService how to persist the stats - possible values are "all" and "request"  
        # request meaning only persist the stats that occur during a request
        # all meaning persist every stat
        persist: request
